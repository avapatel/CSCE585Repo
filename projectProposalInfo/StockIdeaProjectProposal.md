NOTE: This file will reference a powerpoint that focuses on creating a predictive stcok exchange with the goal being developing a model wihth the highest ROI. 
[Purpose]: <> "This file will entail a general representation that'll fit to any prediction problem idea that we have"

First idea of flow for presentation: a) Problem, b) Why and why its interesting, c) Abstract rep of how we want to solve problem, d) Tools irrespective to ML utilized to solve problem, e) Type of ML Used and ML-specific algorithms to solve prediction problem, f) Data that will be fed to these ML-specific algorithms, g) (cont here if applicable)

NOTE: Subsections of topics will be column-adj when put on powerpoint btw. 

NOTE: New Ideas that I came up with:  set {Capital Markets, Investment Banking, Something with Stocks[could mean same thing as Investment banking], Crime Prediction, Car Diagnosis Based Prediction Problem[mainly a subset of my original idea], Predicting relationships between current state of technology and labor-intensive occupations,  Do a predictive towing problem to allow people to evaluate places to take risks to park at without having to pay[could utilize parking ticket data?], (brainstorm will continue on daily basis)}

NOTE: To find datasets, use the following: Popular datasets involving x where x belongs to the aforementioend set: 
```bat
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Capital Markets in UCI Repository or Kaggle"
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Investment Banking in UCI Repository or Kaggle"
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Stocks in UCI Repository or Kaggle"
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Crime in UCI Repository or Kaggle"
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Car Diagonsis in UCI Repository or Kaggle"
start chrome "? Popular datasets involving Parking Ticket Data in UCI Repository or Kaggle"

```
## Problem 

### Our Why
- Problem Statement: (write problem here. Ideally, goal is to quantanize a non-deterministic medium to support decision making in a non-deterministic medium) {some potential probelm statements: 'How can a simulated stock exchange be developed to evaluate and compare predictive models based on real-time and historical marekt edata with ROI as the pimary performance metric'} Attempt 1: There are fanatics of product x in specific industry that aspire to obtain a source of passive income. Making serious financial decisions requires conquering a huge knowledge curve. [can add more if needed] 

- Context: (still need to think about it)
- Quotes from Sources: 1. , 2. , [find at least two sources to provide metrics that contextualize the problem via following search query: `start chrome "? Sources talking about knowledge curve for those that want to get into investment banking when trying to learn independently` ]

### Interests
- Aspiration to solve problem to help customers with x [fill in x with a general reason that fits with all ideas]
- Aspire to open up the options for passive income for people.  

## Solution 

### Tools used to solve problem irrespective to ML
- Mapping of problem with respect to general theoretical ML Solutions: a) . 

### Type of ML Solution used and ML-Specific algorithms to sovle prediction problem[will condense title later]
- Type of ML Problem: Supervised Learning: Classification. 
- Type of ML Used: {Tiny ML, Cloud ML, Edge ML, Mobile ML}[using Cloud ML Soln]
- Proposed algorihtms to assist in solution: a) Linear Regression, b) Decision Trees, and/or SVM(Support Vector Machine)s. 

- How ML will be used: ML will be used to predict x, which will help users with y . [NOTE: x,y will be problem-specific. They will be bijective to the ideas that I wrote previously] Attempt 1: Develop a ML Model specialized in creating predictions to guide investments in companies from a specific industry x.

- Will ML Model be created via data or an existing model be finetuned to solve a specialized problem?: To solve this problem
- Benefits of Using ML Type: a) Provision of Vast Computational Resources, b) Access to advanced tool and alogrithms specialized for machine learning, c) Collaborative environment for seamless teamwork
- Challenges of Using ML Type: a) Latency, b) Data Privacy and Security, c) Network Dependency

## Data that will be fed to these ML-specific solutions 
- Dataset used: <dataset name> from <dataset website> [some pairs (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/390/stock+portfolio+performance,UCI Machine Learning Repo), (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smayanj/stock-market-dataset, Kaggle)(cont here)]
- Why Dataset will be used: This dataset will be used to provide accurate predictions to guide consumers' dcisions in the stock to invest in in the specific industry x  to ensure that the user obtains the maximum Return on Investment.
